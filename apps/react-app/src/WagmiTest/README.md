[] Create an ethereum account with metamask (see the step 3 of this, https://www.web3.university/tracks/create-a-smart-contract/deploy-your-first-smart-contract)
[] Do this quick start and see what the project looks like (https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/create-web3-dapp-quickstart).

## 1. Installation
